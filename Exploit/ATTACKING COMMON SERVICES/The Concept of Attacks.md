To effectively understand attacks on the different services, we should look at how these services can be attacked. A concept is an outlined plan that is applied to future projects.
To explain a little more clearly what we are talking about here, we can try to group the services SSH, FTP, SMB, and HTTP ourselves and figure out what these services have in common. Then we need to create a structure that will allow us to identify the attack points of these different services using a single pattern.

The concept is based on four categories that occur for each vulnerability. First, we have a `Source` that performs the specific request to a `Process` where the vulnerability gets triggered. Each process has a specific set of `Privileges` with which it is executed. Each process has a task with a specific goal or `Destination` to either compute new data or forward it. However, the individual and unique specifications under these categories may differ from service to service.
For any task to come into existence at all, it needs an idea, information (`Source`), a planned process for it (`Processes`), and a specific goal (`Destination`) to be achieved. Therefore, the category of `Privileges` is necessary to control information processing appropriately.
