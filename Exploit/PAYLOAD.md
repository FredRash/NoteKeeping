**staged**
* Sends payload in stages
* Can be less stable
* Example: windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

**Non-staged**
* Sends exploit shellcpde all at once
* Larger in size and won't always work
* Example: windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp

If one type PAYLOAD dosn't work, try the other one, change bitween reverse and bind shell.
