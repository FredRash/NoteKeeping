Focus on one thing at a time!
* Try everything you can think on one thing at a time, then move on
* Let's say we are hacking and expense tracker
	* What does it do?
	* What components are there in the app?
	* How can I modify the request?
	* Can I get to other users info?
	* If I can edit a past expense maybe I can use this to reach another users expenses?
	* Deleting an expense

An Innovator
* In this process of breaking things down we see the big picture
	* Hacking cannot be learned through a lecture - trial and error!
* Finding holes in systems no one else has
	* Solving ambiguous problems
* The question is not
	* Can I break into this System? But how long until I break into it?

* Always try to test positive and negative tests.
* Remember you can drop request in the intercept mode to bypass Access control.
