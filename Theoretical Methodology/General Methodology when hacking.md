For methodology when [enumerating](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian%20Vault&file=Footprinting%2FMethodology) 

1. Focus on one thing at a time!
	* Try everything you can think on one thing at a time, then move on
	* Let's say we are hacking and expense tracker
		* What does it do?
		* What components are there in the app?
		* How can I modify the request?
		* Can I get to other users info?
		* If I can edit a past expense maybe I can use this to reach another users expenses?
		* Deleting an expense

2. An Innovator
	* In this process of breaking things down we see the big picture
		* Hacking cannot be learned through a lecture - trial and error!
	* Finding holes in systems no one else has
		* Solving ambiguous problems
	* The question is not
		* Can I break into this System? But how long until I break into it?

3. Always try to test positive and negative tests.

4. Remember, In a proxy you can drop request in the intercept mode to bypass Access control.

5. Try to find USERNAMES !
	* on the website. usernames can be on emails!
	* on Notes left behind a service like ftp, nfs and [more](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian%20Vault&file=Footprinting%2FHost%20Based%20Enumeration)

6. When finding an Vulnerability and you don't found a way to exploit it, try to find anther  Vulnerability to combine the two for an exploit.
